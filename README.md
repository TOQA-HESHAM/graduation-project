my graduation project from my collage


This project is a custom chatbot designed for organizations and companies.

The system allows managers to upload files containing information about employees, the organization, its services, and other related details.

These files are stored in the chatbotâ€™s database.

Users can then interact with the chatbot by asking questions.

The chatbot searches the uploaded files to find relevant information:

If the answer exists in the database, the chatbot returns the information exactly as it appears in the file.

If the information is not found, the chatbot responds with a message informing the user that the requested data is not available.
